Exercises 1, 2, 3 are required for the badge.

1. In the `data/` folder, there is a list of `.csv` files. Modify the code below to process each file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in ------
do
  head ------
done
```

2. Modify the code in 1) to write a `for` loop in a script to count the number of lines for each `.csv` file. The output should be:

```
echo "${file}\t(wc -l $file)\n"
```

Run the script and redirect your output to `files_out.txt`. Put your bash command you used below:


```bash
```

3. Modify the below script to process the `.sam` files in `./data/`. Save it as `sbatch_sam.sh` and run it. How many files were generated?

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --array=1-________  
module load SAMtools
file_array=(./data/*.sam) 
ind=$((SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID-1)) 
current_file=${file_array[$ind]} 
samtools view -c $current_file > ${current_file}.counts.out
```
