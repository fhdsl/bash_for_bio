All exercises are required for the badge.

1. Copy the below script into a file called `samtools_count.sh`. What does the script do?

```bash
#!/bin/bash
module load SAMtools
samtools view -c $1
```

How would we modify the above script to redirect the output to `${1}.counts.txt`?

```bash

```

2. Modify the below R script to be runnable. It should also take an argument called $FILEPATH for `read.csv()`:

```r
library(tidyverse)
csv_file <- read_csv("myfile.csv")
summary(csv_file)
```

How would you run this on the command line?

```bash
module load fhR
-----
```

3. Modify the below Python script to be runnable. It should also take the first position argument (a file path) and process the file

```{python}
import pandas as pd
csv_file = pd.read_csv("my_file.csv")
csv_file.describe()
```

How would you run this on the command line?

```bash
module load fhPython
-----
```
