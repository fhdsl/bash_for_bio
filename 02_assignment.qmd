All exercises are required for the badge.

1. Copy the below script into a file called `samtools_count.sh`. What does the script do?

```bash
#!/bin/bash
module load SAMtools
samtools view -c $1 
```

How would we modify the above script to redirect the output to `${1}.counts.txt`?

```bash

```

2. Make sure you can get `scripts/week2/run_bwa.sh` to run on `rhino`. 

3. Modify `scripts/week2/run_bwa.sh` to 
    a. Take an additional argument, a folder path
    b. Save the SAM file to this folder path

Hint 1: I recommend that you copy `run_bwa.sh` into a new script and work from there. Put your code into the codeblock below:

```bash

```

Write an example to run your new version of the script below:

```bash

```


For question 4, pick one language to answer.

4R. (R) Modify the below R script and save it to a file called `r_csv_script.R`. It should also take an argument called $FILEPATH for `read.csv()`:

```r
library(tidyverse)
csv_file <- read_csv("myfile.csv")
summary(csv_file)
```

How would you run this on the command line?

```bash
module load fhR
-----
```

How would you redirect the output of your script to a file? 

4Py. (py) Modify the below Python script to be runnable. It should also take the first position argument (a file path) and process the file

```{python}
import pandas as pd
csv_file = pd.read_csv("my_file.csv")
csv_file.describe()
```

How would you run this on the command line?

```bash
module load fhPython
-----
```
