## Terminology

We know that not all of us have the same vocabulary. We try to define terminology as much as possible. These are indicated by double underlines such as this:

{{<glossary "Compute Job">}}

You can click and hold on the term to define it.

## Reference Text

We will be using Julia Evan's Bite Size Bash as our reference text.
