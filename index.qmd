# Bash for Bio {.unnumbered}

## Who this course is for

- Have you needed to align a bunch of FASTA files and not know how to do it? 
- Do you want to automate an R or Python script you wrote to work on a bunch of files?
- Do you want to do all of this on a high performance cluster ({{<glossary HPC>}})?

If so, this course is for you! We will learn enough bash scripting to do useful things on the Fred Hutch cluster. 

## Learning Objectives

- **Articulate** basic HPC architecture concepts and why theyâ€™re useful in your work
- **Apply** bash scripting to execute alignment, and Python/R scripts
- **Navigate** and **process** data on the different filesystems available at FH
- **Leverage** bash scripting to execute jobs on a high performance cluster.
- **Execute** batch processing of multiple files in a project
- **Manage** software dependencies reproducibly using container-based technologies such as Docker/Apptainer containers or EasyBuild modules

## Prerequisites

- You will need an account on `rhino` and know how to connect to it through VPN
- We highly recommend reviewing  [Intro to Command Line](https://hutchdatascience.org/Intro_to_Command_Line/) and [Cluster 101](https://hutchdatascience.org/FH_Cluster_101/)
- Basic knowledge of the following commands:
  - `ls`
  - `cd` and basic directory navigation
  - `mv`/`cp`/`mkdir`/`rm`

## Reference Text

- We will be using Julia Evan's [Bite Size Bash](https://wizardzines.com/zines/bite-size-bash/) as our reference text. Julia's explanations are incredibly clear and it will be a valuable reference even beyond this course. You will receive the PDF as part of class.
- If you want to know the true power of the command line, I recommend [Data Science at the Command Line]().
