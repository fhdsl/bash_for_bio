1. Use `du` to check the disk usage of two folders in your `/home/` directory. 

```bash
du -d 1
```

2. Copy a file from the `scripts/week1/` directory in `bash_for_bio/` to your own home directory.

`/home/tladera2/bash_for_bio/scripts/week1/run_this.sh`

Change the script to executable:

`chmod --- run_this.sh`

Try running it:

`./run_this.sh`

3. Take a look at `scripts/week1/rnorm.R` or `scripts/week1/random_num.py`. Load up the `fhR` or `fhPython` modules on `rhino` using `module load`. Run it on the command line with `Rscript` or `python3`. Did you need to make this script executable?
