## In class code examples


1. Clone the `bash_for_bio` repository into your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhdsl/bash_for_bio
```

Change directories:

```bash
cd bash_for_bio
```


2. Try checking the disk usage using `du` for the `bash_for_bio` folder in your `/home` directory (mine is `/home/tladera2/bash_for_bio`).

```bash
du -d 1 -h /home/tladera2/bash_for_bio/
```

Try out using `du -d -h 2` on your home directory:

```bash
du -d 2 ~/
```


3. What are the permissions for the GitHub repo (bash_for_bio) that you just downloaded?

4. Copy the script `tell_the_time.sh` in the `scripts/week1/` directory to the top directory of `bash_for_bio`. 
Make the script executable. Run the script.

```bash
#put code here
```

5. Try making your own file called `my_file.txt`:

```bash
nano my_file.txt
```

Add some text to it.

Use CTRL-X to exit, and make sure to select "Yes" to save.

6. Change permissions for the `scripts/` folder:

```bash
chmod -R 700 scripts/
```

## Homework Exercises

All exercises are required for the badge.

1. Use `du` to check the disk usage of two folders in your `/bash_for_bio` directory. Set the depth (`-d`) option to 1. Put your code in the box below

```bash
du -d 1 -h -------
```

2. Copy a file from the `scripts/week1/` directory in `bash_for_bio/` to your own home directory.

`/home/tladera2/bash_for_bio/scripts/week1/run_this.sh`

Check the permissions. If necessary, change the script to read/write/executable for yourself:

`chmod --- run_this.sh`

Try running it in your home directory - did it work?

`./run_this.sh`

3. (pick python or R) Take a look at `scripts/week1/rnorm.R` or `scripts/week1/random_num.py`. Load up the `fhR` or `fhPython` modules on `rhino` using `module load`. Run it on the command line with `Rscript` or `python3`. 

Did you need to make this script executable before you ran it?

```bash
module load _____
--------
module purge
```
