1. Use `du` to check the disk usage of two folders in your `/home/` directory. 

```bash
du -d 1
```

2. Copy a file from my directory to your own home directory.

`/home/tladera2/bash_for_bio/run_this.sh`

Change the script to executable:

`chmod --- run_this.sh`

Try running it:

`./run_this.sh`

3. Take a look at `r_example.R` or `python_example.py`. Load up the `fhR` or `fhPython` modules using `module load`. Make the script of your choice executable and run it on the command line with `Rscript` or `python3`.
