## Reminder about Terminology

Defined words are double underlined. You can *click and hold* on them to see the definition. Try it below!

## Navigating the Bash Terminal

> We recommend that you review the material for [Intro to Command Line](https://hutchdatascience.org/Intro_to_Command_Line/) and know the following: [Changing directories and relative paths](https://hutchdatascience.org/Intro_to_Command_Line/command-line-workshop.html#mental-model-1-navigating-a-directory-tree).

By default, when you log into a remote system such as `rhino`, you are in a {{< glossary bash>}} {{< glossary shell >}}.

Why is it a bash shell? Bash is the default shell for linux systems, especially for high performance clusters (HPCs), and there are some quirks about navigating around the command line you should be aware of.

:::{.callout}
## A helpful key: `<Up Arrow>`

The <Up Arrow> key will let you cycle through your history, or previous executed commands. This can be super helpful if you have typed a long command with a syntax error. You can use `<Up Arrow>` to fix mistakes and run that command again.
:::

## Setting Yourself Up for Success

So we have logged into `rhino`. Now what?

## Navigating the Filesystems

### `pwd` Where Am I? 

The `pwd` command (short for *present working directory*) will let you know your current location in the filesystem. Knowing your current directory is critical when using *relative* file paths.

If I run `pwd` right after signing into `rhino` I get:

```
/home/tladera2
```

You should have a similar path, except with your user name. This is your *home directory* - where you have a limited amount of space to store scripts and other files. Don't worry, the majority of your data is stored elsewhere ()

## Going `/home`: `~/` {#sec-home}

There is one important file alias you should always remember: `~/` is shorthand for your own *home directory*.

Depending on the linux distribution, this can be a different location. On the FH filesystem, when I use `~/`, it maps to:

`/home/tladera2/`

The home directory is also important because it is where your configuration files live, such as `.bashrc` (see @sec-bashrc).

Depending on how you work, you may want to store your scripts and workflows in `/home/`. Some people prefer to keep their scripts, data, and results in a single folder. This is not really practical for most genomics projects, unless you are saving processed data. For more info, see @sec-project.

:::{.callout}
## Your current working directory: `.`

There is an alias for your current directory: `.` (the period sign).

This becomes useful when you want to output files to your current location. We'll use this later.
:::

## Grabbing Stuff from GitHub

For the rest of the exercises for today, we'll be grabbing the scripts from github using `git clone`. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhdsl/bash_for_bio
```

This will create a folder called `bash_for_bio/` in our current directory. This directory has all of the course materials, including the scripts.

:::{.callout-important}
## Stay in `bash_for_bio/`

Throughout this course, I expect you to run code in the base `bash_for_bio/` folder, not in `scripts` or in `data`. All of the code is tested with this in mind. 

If you are having problems executing the code, please make sure you are in the base `bash_for_bio` folder, or adjust your file paths when running the script.
:::

### `du`: How much space?

One of the first things we can do is check for disk usage with the `du` command. If I run `du` by itself on the command line, it will give me the disk usage of all folders and files in our current directory, which is a lot of output.

There is an option called `-d` that lets us specify the *depth*. `-d 1` will give us only the file sizes of the top level folders in our directory. 

Make sure you are in the `bash_for_bio/` directory. Then try the following command:

```bash
du -d 1 -h .
```

Here are the first few lines of my `du` output within the `bash_for_bio` folder: 

```
240K	./_extensions
192K	./.quarto
616K	./scripts
1.9M	./data
8.6M	./.git
6.7M	./docs
10M	./images
30M	.

```

If we want to specify `du` to scan only a single folder, we can give the folder name.

```bash
du -d 1 scripts
```

And I will get the following output:

```
144K	scripts/week1
56K	scripts/__pycache__
128K	scripts/week3
232K	scripts/week2
616K	scripts
```

:::{.callout}
### Try it out

Try checking the disk usage using `du` for the `bash_for_bio/` folder in your `/home` directory (mine is `/home/tladera2/bash_for_bio/`).

```bash
du -d 1 bash_for_bio/
```

Try out using `du -d 2` on your home directory:

```bash
du -d 2 ~/
```
:::

## FH users: the main filesystems {#sec-filesystems}

When working on the Fred Hutch HPC, there are four main filesystems you should consider:

- `/home/` - The home filesystem. Your scripts can live here. Also where your configuration files (such as `.bashrc`) live. Can be accessed using `~/`.
- `/fh/fast/` (also known as `fast`) - Research storage. Raw files and processed results should live here. 
- `/hpc/temp/` (also known as `temp`) - The temporary filesystem. This filesystem is faster to access for gizmo nodes on the cluster, so files can be copied to for computation. The output files you generate should be moved back into an appropriate folder on `/fh/fast/`. Note that files on `/hpc/temp/` will be deleted after 30 days. 
- `/fh/regulated/` - A secure filesystem meant for NIH regulated data. If you are processing data that is regulated under the current NIH guidelines, you will process it here.

So, how do we utilize these filesystems? We will be running commands like this:

```bash
ml BWA                                                # <1>
bwa mem -M -t 2 \                                      # <2>
  /fh/fast/reference_data/chr20 \                        # <3>
  /fh/fast/laderas_t/raw_data/na12878_1.fq \             # <4>
  /fh/fast/laderas_t/raw_data/na12878_2.fq > \             # <4>
  /hpc/temp/laderas_t/aligned_data/na12878_1.sam      # <5>   
```
1. Load bwa software
2. Start `bwa mem` (aligner)
3. path of genome index
4. path of paired end reads files
5. path of output

To understand the above, We first have to familiarize ourselves with *absolute* vs *relative* paths.

:::{.callout}
## When you need to span multiple lines: `\`

Sometimes it's hard to read code that is a single line. You can break up a very long line of code using the `\` (backslash) character.

For example, instead of:

```bash
bwa mem -M -t 2 /fh/fast/reference_data/chr20 /fh/fast/laderas_t/raw_data/na12878_1.fq /fh/fast/laderas_t/raw_data/na12878_2.fq > /hpc/temp/laderas_t/aligned_data/na12878_1.sam  
```

We can rewrite it as:

```bash
ml BWA                                                
bwa mem -M -t 2 \                                     
  /fh/fast/reference_data/chr20 \      #<1>                 
  /fh/fast/laderas_t/raw_data/na12878_1.fq \  #<2>            
  /fh/fast/laderas_t/raw_data/na12878_2.fq > \  #<3>          
  /hpc/temp/laderas_t/aligned_data/na12878_1.sam #<4>      
```
1. Path of reference genome
2. 1st paired end read FASTQ file
3. 2nd paired end read FASTQ file
4. Output file location

We'll use this throughout the book so the code is easier to read.

### More about the FH Filesystems

<https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/store_posix/>

## Absolute versus relative paths {#sec-paths}

You may have muddled with file paths, and maybe have used absolute paths to specify the location of a file. When you are processing files, it is important to understand the difference.

**Absolute paths** contain all the information needed to find a file in a file system from the root `/` directory. For example, this would be an absolute path:

```
/fh/fast/laderast/immuno_project/raw_data/chr2.fa.gz
```

Absolute paths always start with `/`, because that is the root directory, where all the top folders and files live. 

In terms of folder structure, this is what this looks like:

```bash
/                                     # <1>
├── fh                                # <2>
│   └──fast
│       └──laderast
|            └──immuno_project
│                 └──raw_data
│                    └──chr2.fa.gz
```
1. Root directory
2. Folders in root directory

**Relative paths** break up an absolute path into two pieces of information: 1) your current directory and 2) the path *relative* to that directory. Relative paths are really helpful because things don't break when you move your folder or files. 

If my current working directory is the directory `/fh/fast/laderas_t/immuno_project/`, then the relative path to that same file would be:

```
raw_data/chr2.fa.gz
```

We can visualize the relative path like this, where our working directory is indicated by a star:

```bash
/                                                      # <1>
├── fh/fast/laderast/immuno_project/                   # <2>
|                                   └──raw_data        # <3>
│                                      └──chr2.fa.gz   # <3>
                                    
```
1. The root directory
2. Our working directory
3. Our relative path

Note that this relative path does not start with a `/`, because our current directory isn't the root directory. Relative paths are incredibly useful when scripting in a reproducible manner, such as using project-based workflows to process files in a single folder.

:::{.callout}
## `<TAB>` is for autocompletion of paths

Never underestimate the usefulness of the `<TAB>` key, which triggers autocompletion on the command line. It can help you complete paths to files and save you a lot of typing.

For example, say I have a path that I want to navigate to

`/home/tladera2/my_long_path`

I can type in the first part of the path and then hit `<TAB>`:

`/home/tladera2/my_<TAB>` 

And if the prefix `my_` is unique in my folder, it will autocomplete the path:

`/home/tladera2/my_long_path`

Note that we need to use enough of the folder name so that completing it is unambiguous. If there are multiple choices, then autocomplete will list all of them.
:::


## File Permissions {#sec-permissions}

File permissions are {{< glossary metadata>}} that are attached to file objects. They are how the system prevents certain files from being modified or restricting access of these files to certain people or groups.

All files have the following level of access permissions:

|Level|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Owner-level|The owner of the file|
|Group-level|The group of the file|
|Everyone|The rest of the world|

For example, if I'm the owner of the file, I can restrict the type of access to only myself (owner-level), the group I'm in (Group-level), or make the file freely available to everyone on the system (Everyone).

Each level has the following type of access:

|Type|Description|Abbreviation|Example|
|----|-----------|------------|-------|
|Read|Level can only read contents of file|`r`|A list of users in a text file|
|Write|Level can write to the file|`w`|Appending an entry to the end of a log|
|Execute|Level can run the file as an executable|`x`|samtools|

You can see the permissions for a file using the `ls -l <FILENAME>`. For example: 

```bash
ls -l -h .
```

will give me the following line:

```bash
-rw-rw---- 1 tladera2 g_tladera2 1.8K Oct  2 15:21 01_assignment.qmd
-rw-rw---- 1 tladera2 g_tladera2  21K Oct  2 15:21 01_basics.qmd
-rw-rw---- 1 tladera2 g_tladera2 2.3K Oct  2 15:21 02_assignment.qmd
-rw-rw---- 1 tladera2 g_tladera2  21K Oct  2 15:21 02_scripting.qmd
-rw-rw---- 1 tladera2 g_tladera2 1.2K Oct  2 15:21 03_assignment.qmd
-rw-rw---- 1 tladera2 g_tladera2  13K Oct  2 15:21 03_batch.qmd
-rw-rw---- 1 tladera2 g_tladera2    0 Oct  2 15:21 04_assignment.qmd
```

It's this first part that we want to examine:

```
        everyone_else
        |     
-rw-rw----
 |  |
 you group
```

The 2nd to 4th letters define your own access to the files. The 

```
rw-
```

Means that you have **r**ead and **w**rite access. If we had the following:

```
rwx
```

That would mean we have read, write, and e**x**ecute access.

Similarly, the 5th to 7th letters are the permissions for your group. In many cases at Fred Hutch, the group level maps to your lab or group.

The last 3 letters correspond to *everyone else*.

In this case, since the permissions are:

```
---
```

That means that everyone else cannot read, write, or execute your files.

The cardinal rule to remember is that: 

> If you want to run a file as an executable, you (or your group) needs to have executable level permission.

For example, if I want to run a script called `run_samtools.sh` in my directory like this:

```
./run_samtools.sh my_bam_file.bam
```

I will need to have execute privileges at the user, group, or others level for `run_samtools.sh`.

We can change the permissions of our files using the `chmod` command. 

:::{.callout}
## Helpful unix permissions situations

I tend to just go by memory when setting file permissions. These are the common situations that I've encountered that I use regularly:

|Situation|Command|
|---------|-------|
|Only I can execute/read/write a file|`chmod 700 <filename>`|
|Only I and my group can read a file|`chmod 110 <filename>` |
|Only I and my group can read/write/execute a file|`chmod 770 <filename>` |
|Grant my group read permissions|`chmod 710 <filename>`|
|Make executable/read/write by all|`chmod 777 <filename>`|

For right now, let's set scripts to be read/write/executable by us:

```
chmod -R 700 scripts/
```

This will save us some headaches when we try to execute our scripts.

If you have different permission situations that you need to set, please refer to: <https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/linux-file-permissions-explained>
:::

:::{.callout}
## Even if you don't have execute permissions

With `bash` scripts, you can still run them if you have `read` permissions. You can still run bash scripts by using the `bash` command:

```
bash run_samtools.sh my_bam_file.bam
```

This is also the case for scripts that use she-bangs (@sec-shebang) for R or Python or any other executable.
:::

### Try it out

What are the permissions for the GitHub repo (bash_for_bio) that you just downloaded?

## Moving Things Around {#sec-moving}

A lot of the time, we need to move files between shared filesystems. One filesystem might be good at storage and be backed up on a regular basis, while another filesystem might be better for temporary work on the cluster. 

You might be familiar with `mv`, which lets you move files around in Unix. One thing to keep in mind when you're `mv`ing things to a new folder that there is a difference between:

```bash
mv log.txt my_folder   ## renames log.txt to my_folder
```

and

```bash
mv log.txt my_folder/  ## moves log.txt to be in my_folder
```
This is one thing that still trips me up all the time. 

This is one situation where using a GUI such as [Motuz](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/motuz/) can be very helpful. You don't have to worry about accidentally renaming files. 

Other tools for sync'ing between filesystems include `rsync`, which requires careful reading of documentation. 

:::{.callout}
### Things I always forget: the difference between `/home/mydir/`  and `home/mydir/`

Some things that trip me up all the time. The difference between 

```bash
/home/mydir/    #absolute path
```
and 

```bash
home/mydir/     #relative path
```
The first one is an *absolute path*, and the second is a *relative path*. Your clue is the leading `/` at the beginning of a path. If you're getting `file not found` messages, check to make sure the path is the right format.
:::

### Keep Everything in Folders

We need to talk about code and data organization. For the FH system, we have a `/home/` directory, and if we have generated research data, a `/fh/fast/` directory. If we want our scripts to live in `/home/` and our data is in `/hpc/temp/`, we'll need to refer to each of these file locations.

Ideally, we want to make the naming conventions of our code and our data as similar as possible.


:::{.callout-note}
## Try it Out

Copy the script `tell_the_time.sh` in the `scripts/week1/` directory to the top directory of `bash_for_bio`. 

Make the script executable.
:::

## What's in the script

We can see what's in the script by using `cat`:

```bash
cat tell_the_time.sh
```

And you'll get the following: 

```
#!/bin/bash
date
```


## Running a Bash Script

Ok, now we have a bash script `tell_the_time.sh` in our current directory, how do we run it?

Because the script is not on our `$PATH` (@sec-path), we'll need to use `./` to execute it. `./` is an alias for the current folder, and it is an indicator to bash that the command we want to execute is in our current folder.

```bash
tladera2$ ./tell_the_time.sh
```

If we haven't set the permissions (@sec-permissions) correctly, we'll get this message:

```
bash: ./scripts/tell_the_time.sh: Permission denied
```

But if we have execute access, we'll get something like this:

```
Fri Jul 11 13:27:47 PDT 2025
```

Which is the current date and time.

## Editing on a Linux Machine

On the `rhino` machines, we have the option to use the `nano` editor. `nano` is the most like a word processor or code editors.

- Open a file in `nano`: `nano <filename>`
- Save and quit: `<CTRL> + x` and then  `yes`
- Navigate in file: using the arrow keys will work
- Find in file: `<CTRL> + w`
- Copy from outside the terminal (dependent on terminal program)

Pasting will depend on your terminal program. On macs it is Command-V, and on PuTTY it is using Right Click on the mouse

### Try it Out

Try making your own file called `my_file.txt`:

```bash
nano my_file.txt
```

Add some text to it.

Use CTRL-X to exit, and make sure to select "Yes" to save.

### Editing on your own machine

One thing you can do to make your life easier is to edit scripts with an editor on your own machine that is connected to `rhino` through Samba. You will able to open up files you create in the editor of you choice on your system, and when you save the file, the changes will be make on `rhino`.

Instructions are here: <https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/store_posix/#how-to-access-fred-hutch-storage> and follow the instructions for mapping your network drive ([Mac](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/u/it/help-desk/mapping-network-drives.html#mac)) and ([Windows](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/u/it/help-desk/mapping-network-drives.html#windows)).

You will want to use the connection strings specified for `home`.

## Running an R or Python Script on the command line {#sec-rpy}

### Loading the `fhR` or `fhPython` modules

Before we can run our scripts in R or Python, we'll need to load up either R or Python on the cluster. We can do this with the `module load` command:

```bash
module load fhR  #<1>
module load fhPython  #<2>
```
1. Load up `fhR` module - has R and most packages installed
2. Load up `fhPython` module - has Python and most packages installed.

We'll talk more about software modules next week (@sec-modules). 

### R Users

You might not be aware that there are multiple ways to run R: 

1) as an interactive console, which is what we usually use in an IDE such as RStudio
2) on the command line using the `Rscript` command.

```bash
Rscript my_r_script.R
```

To run this script, we'll need to first load `fhR`:

```bash
module load fhR
Rscript my_r_script.R
module purge
```

### Python Users

Python users are much more aware that you can run Python scripts on the command line:

```
python3 my_python_script.py
```

To execute this on `gizmo`, we'll first need to load `fhPython`:

```bash
module load fhPython
python3 my_python_script.py
module purge
```

Within a shell script, you can also use a shebang (@sec-shebang) to make your script executable by providing the location of `python3`:

```
#!/bin/python3
python3 my_python_script.py
```

## Getting Help

You may have heard about man pages. You can usually get help by using the `man` command:

```bash
man wc
```

This is the first part of the output:

```
NAME
     wc – word, line, character, and byte count

SYNOPSIS
     wc [--libxo] [-Lclmw] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is
     specified) to the standard output.  A line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a ⟨newline⟩ character.
     Characters beyond the final ⟨newline⟩ character will not be included in the line count.

     A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white space characters.  White space characters are the set of
     characters for which the iswspace(3) function returns true.  If more than one input file is specified, a line of cumulative
     counts for all the files is displayed on a separate line after the output for the last file.

     The following options are available:

         --libxo
             Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3)
             for details on command line arguments.

     -L      Write the length of the line containing the most bytes (default) or characters (when -m is provided) to standard
             output.  When more than one file argument is specified, the longest input line of all files is reported as the value
             of the final “total”.

```

I personally find man pages very hard to read, especially when there are lots of options for a command. 

Instead, I use `tldr`, which contain examples of the most commonly used options in a command.  It is not installed on gizmo, but you can use the page at <https://tldr.inbrowser.app/>, which has all of the `tldr` help pages.


## Recap

We learned the following this week:

- **Navigate** and **copy** data to the different filesystems available at Fred Hutch.
- **Explain** the difference between *absolute* and *relative* file paths.
- **Set** Permissions on and **execute** a bash script 
- **Find** help on the system

## Next Week

We'll focus on adding *arguments* to our scripts, and more about software modules
